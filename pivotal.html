                  <p>Pivotal helps companies deliver exceptional user experiences through adoption of platform, tools and methodology. 
                    In summer of 2018 I joined Pivotal Cloud Foundry, the cloud-native platform that enables Pivotal's customor companies to build 
                    stable, secure software quickly, efficiently, and at scale.
                   
                    
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="case-subtitle">My Role</h2>
                    <p>I worked on Apps Manager, the web interface product that developers and operators use to manage and monitor apps that are deployed on Cloud Foundry.
                     My role was working directly with a product management intern to explore opportunities to improve Apps Manager through
                     research-driven product strategy. I also completed interaction and visual design for these solutions.</p>

                  <h2 class="case-subtitle">The Problem</h2>
                  <p>Pivotal Cloud Foundry is expanding at a rapid pace - and so are the companies who run on it. While Apps Manager features expand just in time with PCF's growth and customer needs,
                    it's user experience wasn't ideal for companies at scale. Finding and managing apps in a foundations containing a hundred to a thousand apps
                    became difficult for an interface that wasn't built for that much volume, so our challenge was to create a solution to help users navigate their foundation so that they can find the apps they need.

                  <p>Improving the <span class="bold">information architecture</span> of Apps Manager meant improving the experience of app developers and app operators going through their different workflows in the hierarchy of apps, spaces and orgs.
                      Working on the <span class="bold">navigation</span> consisted of designing the UI components necessary to navigate these flows. Below is the original state of Apps Manager.

                                  spent a lot of time getting to their apps despite that being their main area of work. This was something we realized after going through

                        <p>App operators, who tend to take admin roles, need higher level perspectives to manage entire foundations, user permissions, storage, 
                          services and more. Creating access to a foundation level through a <span class="bold">Foundation Page </span> furthers this access, and is in sync with the overall product direction for Cloud Foundry.

                    <h4>More Insight on Customer Usage</h4>
                    <p>We got a lot of our research from anecdotal, qualitative data from internal developers, new and existing user proxies and broad metrics on user interactions. 
                      We can validate this new implementation of the information architecture of Apps Manager even further by getting <span class="bold">direct user input and in-depth quantitative data</span>on the platform to see what these findings look like at scale and to validate our research.
                       Having more data would allows for us to have greater confidence and narrow down our solutions even further.
                    </p>

                    <h4>The Future of Apps Manager</h4>
                    <p>What are the workflows we can optimize for as the functionalities continue to grow? 
                      Will A.M. continue to remain user-type ambiguous (operator + dev) product? 
                      Will those functionalities split in the future?
                    </p>

                    <h4>Will Apps Manager be Multi-foundation?</h4>
                    <p>The scope of this project didnâ€™t go into depth to include a multi-foundation app monitoring experience, though now we see that becoming a huge factor for where Apps manager goes in the future.
