                  <p>Pivotal helps companies deliver exceptional user experiences through adoption of platform, tools and methodology. 
                    In summer of 2018 I joined Pivotal Cloud Foundry, the cloud-native platform that enables Pivotal's customor companies to build 
                    stable, secure software quickly, efficiently and at scale.
                   
                    
                    </p>
                    <p>I worked on Apps Manager, the web interface product that developers and operators use to manage and monitor apps that are deployed on Cloud Foundry.
                     My role was working directly with a product management intern to explore opportunities to improve Apps manager through
                     research-driven product strategy. I also completed interaction and visual design for these solutions.</p>

                  <h2 class="case-subtitle">The Problem</h2>
                  <p>Pivotal Cloud Foundry is expanding at a rapid pace - and so are the companies who run on it. While Apps Manager functionality expands just in time with PCF's growth and cudtomer needs,
                    it's user experience wasn't ideal for companies at scale. Finding and managing apps in a foundations containing a hundred to a thousand apps
                    became difficult for an interface that wasn't built for that much volume, so our challenge was to create a solution to help users navigate their foundation so that they can find the apps they need.
                      <h4>How much of a pain-point is the information architecture of AM? How does navigation help or impede user flows? How can we optimize this for current users?</h4>
                    </p>


                    <h2 class="case-subtitle">Information Architecture Defined</h2>
                  <p>Improving the <span class="bold">information architecture</span> of Apps Manager meant improving the experience of app developers and app operators going through their different workflows in the hierarchy of apps, spaces and orgs.
                      Working on the <span class="bold">navigation</span> consists of design the UI components necessary to navigate these flows.

                  <p>While we knew that some parts of the information architecture affected user experience it was difficult to understand the experiences of our specific user group without doing more research into who used Apps Manager for what tasks.
                    After speaking with teams working on related products, user proxies and product management, we found that our users were split into two groups: <span class="bold">app developers and app operators.</span> </p>

                        <p>We narrowed the problems we wanted to focus on by prioritizing them based on level of user pain-point and technical feasability.
                          After sorting, we then took the problems with the highest painpoints and highest feasbility (top right wuadrant) and our product team voted based on importance.

                        <p>In the end were able to isolate the most prevelant and important problems:
                          <ul>
                            <li><span class="bold">It is a challenge to find specific spaces/orgs in an scaled environment</span></li>

                            <li><span class="bold">Starting from the org state does not cater well to the primary use cases of developers</span></li>
                            <li><span class="bold">Users struggle to orient themselves and navigate from their current state.</span></li>

                            <p>By using user testing as a baseline, we learned that some components needed to be rethought to become more usable in our current solution. For example, the 
                                search bar which was originally only for apps now searched globally, so in the new solution it had to be optimized for different types of results.

                    <h4>More Insight on Customer Usage</h4>
                    <p>We got a lot of our research from anecdotal, qualitative data from internal developers, new and existing user proxies and broad metrics on user interactions. 
                      We can validate this new implementation of the information architecture of Apps Manager even further by getting <span class="bold">direct user input and in-depth quantitative data</span>on the platform to see what these findings look like at scale and to validate our research.
                       Having more data would allows for us to have greater confidence and narrow down our solutions even further.
                    </p>

                    <h4>The Future of Apps Manager</h4>
                    <p>What are the workflows we can optimize for as the functionalities continue to grow? 
                      Will A.M. continue to remain user-type ambiguous (operator + dev) product? 
                      Will those functionalities split in the future?
                    </p>

                    <h4>Will Apps Manager be Multi-foundation?</h4>
                    <p>The scope of this project didn’t go into depth to include a multi-foundation app monitoring experience, though now we see that becoming a huge factor for where Apps manager goes in the future. 
                    </p>

                        <p>Moving forward we're continuing to ask questions about how we can sync both contractors and customers together while improving on clarity. We're also starting to work on content strategy and designing a customer dashboard flow for users to manage their projects.
                           I'm continuing to iterate on these designs we continue to understand user needs better.</p>
